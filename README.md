PerfectoMiner is a GPU management system based on the Raspberry Pi3 microcomputer.

1. Centralized management of all functions of rigs and monitoring (currency selection, overclocking of video cards and coolers, hardware shutting down / rebooting);
2. Saving money: you do not need flash and hard drives, also hardware WatchDog for 20 rigs is already built into the device.
3. Save time: there is no need to install and reinstall, as well as configure the OS, drivers, you do not need to monitor the updates of the mining programs.
4. All necessary settings are entered 1 time and automatically applied to all available capacities.
5. Booting rigs over the network is a secure, isolated intranet system
6. Soft base - the service working on any Linux distributives. (Will be in a future releases)
7. It is planned to integrate a decentralized exchange of the shapeshift type so that the you can exchange from one crypt into another in time.
