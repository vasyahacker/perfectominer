------

PerfectoMiner is a GPU management system based on the Raspberry Pi3 microcomputer.

- Centralized management of all functions of rigs and monitoring (currency selection, overclocking of video cards and coolers, hardware shutting down / rebooting);
- Saving money: you do not need flash and hard drives, also hardware WatchDog for 20 rigs is already built into the device.
- Save time: there is no need to install and reinstall, as well as configure the OS, drivers, you do not need to monitor the updates of the mining programs.
- All necessary settings are entered 1 time and automatically applied to all available capacities.
- Booting rigs over the network is a secure, isolated intranet system
- Soft base - the service working on any Linux distributives. (Will be in a future releases)
- It is planned to integrate a decentralized exchange of the shapeshift type so that the you can exchange from one crypt into another in time.
